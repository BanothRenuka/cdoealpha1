            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The manufacturing sector has undergone significant transformation over the past few decades, driven by rapid advancements in automation, digital technologies, and artificial intelligence. Robotics has emerged as a cornerstone of this transformation, particularly within the framework of Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 represents the fourth industrial revolution, characterized by the integration of cyber-physical systems, the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and smart automation into manufacturing processes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Robotics in modern manufacturing is no longer limited to repetitive, pre-programmed tasks. Instead, robots are increasingly intelligent, collaborative, and adaptable, capable of working alongside humans and responding dynamically to changes in production environments. This report explores the applications of robotics in manufacturing within the context of Industry 4.0, examining key technologies, benefits, challenges, and future trends.

            <h2>2. Evolution of Robotics in Manufacturing</h2>
            <p>
                The use of robots in manufacturing dates back to the 1960s with the introduction of the first industrial robot, Unimate, which was used in automobile assembly lines. Early industrial robots were large, expensive, and isolated from human workers due to safety concerns. Their primary function was to perform repetitive and hazardous tasks such as welding, painting, and material handling.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over time, advancements in sensors, control systems, and computing power enabled robots to become more precise and versatile. The emergence of programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and computer numerical control (CNC) systems further expanded the role of automation in factories. Today, robotics has evolved into a core component of smart factories, where machines communicate with each other and make decentralized decisions.

            <h2>3. Key Robotics Technologies in Industry 4.0</h2>
            <p>
                Industry 4.0 integrates robotics with several advanced technologies. Collaborative robots, or cobots, are designed to work safely alongside humans without physical barriers. They are equipped with force sensors and vision systems that allow them to detect human presence and adjust their movements accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Artificial intelligence and machine learning play a crucial role in enhancing robotic capabilities. AI-powered robots can analyze data from sensors, predict equipment failures, optimize production schedules, and adapt to variations in manufacturing processes. Machine vision systems enable robots to identify objects, inspect quality, and perform complex assembly tasks with high accuracy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another important technology is digital twins, which are virtual replicas of physical systems. Digital twins allow manufacturers to simulate robotic operations, test process changes, and identify inefficiencies before implementing them in real-world environments.

            <h2>4. Applications of Robotics in Manufacturing</h2>
            <p>
                Robotics is widely used across various manufacturing processes. In automotive manufacturing, robots perform welding, painting, assembly, and inspection tasks with exceptional speed and precision. Electronics manufacturing relies heavily on robots for delicate assembly operations such as placing microchips and soldering components.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, robots are increasingly used in logistics and warehouse automation. Autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) transport materials within factories, reducing manual handling and improving efficiency. In quality control, robotic inspection systems equipped with cameras and sensors can detect defects that are invisible to the human eye.

            <h2>5. Benefits of Robotics in Industry 4.0</h2>
            <p>
                The adoption of robotics in manufacturing offers numerous benefits. One of the most significant advantages is increased productivity. Robots can operate continuously without fatigue, leading to higher output and reduced production cycle times. They also improve product quality by ensuring consistent precision and minimizing human error.
            </p>
            <p>
                Robotics enhances workplace safety by taking over hazardous tasks that expose workers to risks such as extreme temperatures, toxic substances, and heavy lifting. Furthermore, the integration of robotics with data analytics enables predictive maintenance, reducing downtime and maintenance costs.
